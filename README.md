### This query combines transaction, branch, and product data into one unified table to facilitate business performance. This table automatically calculates various important metrics such as net sales, gross profit percentage by price level, and net profit. We can also see the performance of each branch complete with its location and rating. The result is a ready-to-use dataset that allows business teams to evaluate sales, product profitability, and branch performance more effectively. This solution was developed as part of Rakamin's challenge to build a comprehensive analytics system.
